<!-- 
    Welcome to Lesson 4 - Challenge 1
In the last two challenges, you added the following to your recipe page:
The recipe name
The recipe description
The ingredients heading
The list of ingredients
The preparation heading
The preparation steps
The copyright text
All that's left in terms of content is the adding of a recipe image to the page.
Your challenge is to do just that.

Steps
Within the < header > element remove image the placeholder text and add an <img> element. Set its src attribute value to " https://codeinstitute.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/5DCC/images/Content/oSVKMED.jpg ",
Or you can choose your own image. If you do, please make sure the image has a .png or .jpg file extension name
Give < img > element an alt attribute. The alt attribute should be a short description of the image. Eg. alt="A man drinking tea" , The inclusion of the alt attribute helps screen readers determine content meaning for sight-impaired users

        <p>At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day.
            On top of that, studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up.
                Oxygen in water helps flavour!
            </li>
            <li>
                Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time
                to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or
                you'll make it bitter.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy!
            </li>
