        <p>
          At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid
          into your body each day. On top of that, studies have shown teas can
          help protect your teeth and your heart

            Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it
            once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
          </li>
          <li>Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)</li>
          <li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
          <li>
            Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to
            do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or
            daydream about vacations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against
            the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at
            all.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
