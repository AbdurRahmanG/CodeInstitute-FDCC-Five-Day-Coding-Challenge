<!-- 
    Welcome to your Lesson 2 Challenge 3
Every HTML element can be assigned a unique identifier. This is done by including an id attribute and its associated value in the element's opening tag. Element ids should be unique to each element on a page. They should also be given a meaningful name that describes what the element is being used for. We can use CSS to target an id
 
In particular, you will:
Add an id and its value to a div element
Add an id and its value to the div's child paragraph element
You'll then target these ids with unique styles

Steps
A style rule that targets the div has already been created for you. You will need to create the second style rule to target the paragraph

Add an id attribute to the < div > element and give it the value " heading" . Our #heading style rule will now target that div
Add an id attribute to the <p> element within the < div > element, give it the value " uppercase"
Create a style rule on line 14 that has an id selector name of #uppercase. This will target our paragraph
Within that rule add a declaration that sets the text-transform property to uppercase

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>Targeting an individual</title>
    <style>
        #heading {
            font-family: Arial;
            background-color: red;
            color: white;
        }

        /* create your rule here */
        #uppercase {
            text-transform: uppercase;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>

    <!-- Add the correct id to this element -->
    <div id="heading">

        <h1>Sporting History</h1>

        <!-- add the correct id to this element -->
        <p id="uppercase">Giants & Heroes</p>

    </div>

    <h3> Track & Field</h3>
    <p>
        Some sporting feats ridicule expectations, fewer violate logic but the rarest of all added a defying of gravity
        to a hat-trick of achievements. At 3.45pm on 18 October 1968 in Mexico City's Estadio Olmpico Universitario Bob
        Beamon accomplished all three.

    <h3>Rugby</h3>
    <p>
        With the game locked at 10 - 10 with thirty minutes on the clock, a Munster scrum just outside the Biarritz line
        enabled Peter Stringer to do the unexpected and break on the blindside for an unforgettable try. A moment of
        sheer brilliance by the Munster and Ireland scrumhalf. The try proved to be crucial as Munster won by 23 - 19 to
        lift the European Cup in Cardiff.

    <h3>The first Programmer</h3>
    <p>
        Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed
        mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had
        applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a
        machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing
        machine" and the first computer programmer.

    <h3>The first Compiler</h3>
    <p>
        Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first
        programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the
        first compiler related tools.
