<!-- 
    Welcome to your Lesson 2 - Challenge 1
In particular, you will:
style a <h1> element
style a <p> element
style an <em> element
style a <strong> element
You'll do this by using element selectors (style rules that have the same selector names as the HTML elements they are targeting).
In this challenge, each style rule will contain one style declaration that will target its associated HTML element.

Steps
As you can see in the edit panel to the left, we have already started this for you by
creating a style rule for the <body> element, using its HTML Element selector name
creating a declaration giving it a font-size property
setting the property value to 14px
Create an h1 style rule within the < style > element and below the body
Set the  h1 rule color property to gold . - Note the US spelling of color -
Create a p rule below the h1 rule
Set the p rule color property to darkslategray
Create an em rule below the p rule
Set the em rule font-size property to 20px
Create a strong rule below the em rule
Set the strong rule font-size property to 24px
